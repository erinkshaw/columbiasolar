        The solar farm will generate at least <a href="http://www.shepherdsrunsolar.com/news/2020/02/hecate-energy-announces-shepherds-run-solar-for-columbia-county-project-brings-57-million-benefits-package--economic-boost-to-region/">
        $5 million to $7 million</a> in property taxes. 
        That's enough money for the Town of Copake to cut every homeowner’s property taxes ー for the next 20 years.

      <Header as="h3">🔌 Cheaper power</Header>

      Columbia County pulls <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qtw5G3kuebIgT5yb49TUsAQXfJMZIwxXqrZiWDonzzI/edit#gid=0">
      85% of its power</a> from neighboring counties. 
      By generating our own electricity, and <a href="https://www.hudsonvalleyenergy.org/community-choice-aggregation">
      buying it directly</a> from the solar company, we could lower everyone’s bills.

      <p>
        We all love Copake’s rural charm, and we all want to conserve it.
        Shepherd’s Run will indeed place panels on top of farmland. But after
        three decades of corn and cattle, that land is tired and yields are
        down.
      </p>
      <p> By surrounding panels with <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20485438-hecate-energy-shepherds-run-solar-farm-open-house-12092020#document/p11/a2018868">
        native plants</a>, the solar farm can

        restore</a> the soil and <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20485438-hecate-energy-shepherds-run-solar-farm-open-house-12092020#document/p11/a2018868">

      <Header as="h3">✊ Real climate action</Header>
      <p>
        Devastating heat waves, floods, and hurricanes are <a href="https://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/regions/northeast#statement-16958">
        coming to Copake</a> — unless we finally get real about climate change. 
      </p>
      <p>
        360 acre solar farms is what getting real looks like. To avoid climate catastrophe, 
        New York state and America need <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/20485442-nys-clcpa-fact-sheet#document/p1/a2018877">
        100% clean electricity</a> in the next 20 years. 
        That means building <b>hundreds</b> of solar farms in rural towns across the state. 
        That’s just the reality we’re in now, and we’re proud to do our part.
