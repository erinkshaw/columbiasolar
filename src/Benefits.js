      <Header as="h3">💸 Lower taxes</Header>
      <p>
        The solar farm will generate $5 million to $7 million in property taxes
        for Copake. That will enable the town to cut every homeowner’s property
        taxes ー for the next 20 years.

      <Header as="h3">🔌 Cheaper power</Header>
      <p>
        Columbia County pulls TK% of its power from neighboring counties. By
        generating our own electricity, and buying it directly from the solar
        company, we could lower everyone’s bills.

      <Header as="h3">🐝 Restored farmland</Header>
      <p>
        We all love Copake’s rural charm, and we all want to conserve it.
        Shepherd’s Run will indeed place panels on top of farmland. But after
        three decades of corn and cattle, that land is tired and yields are
        down. By surrounding panels with native plants, the solar farm can
        restore the soil and nurture bees, butterflies, and other pollinators
        that farms depend on.

      <Header as="h3">✊ Real climate action</Header>
      <p>
        Devastating heat waves, floods, and hurricanes are coming to Copake —
        unless we finally get real about climate change. 280 acres of solar
        panels is what getting real looks like. To avoid climate catastrophe,
        New York state and America need 100% clean electricity in the next 20
        years. That means building hundreds of solar farms in rural towns across
        the state. That’s just the reality we’re in now, and we’re proud to do
        our part.
