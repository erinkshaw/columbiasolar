            The crystalline silicon solar panels at Shepherd‚Äôs Run are the same
            type that go on your roof. They‚Äôre made of glass, aluminum, plastic,
            and silicon. All these materials are recyclable. None of them are
            toxic. So there‚Äôs no risk of the panels cracking open and
            contaminating people, animals, or soil.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shepherd‚Äôs Farm panels won‚Äôt have concrete foundations. Steel beams
            will be driven straight into the ground, so no cement will be left
            in the soil. Soil erosion: Poorly designed solar farms can cause
            soil erosion and storm-water runoff. Hecate plans to limit this by
            planting native plants with deep roots.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike other power plants, solar farms don‚Äôt consume water to
            produce power. They don‚Äôt leach materials into the ground. And
            plants can be used to prevent soil runoff. So Shepherd‚Äôs Run
            shouldn‚Äôt hurt the quality of Copake‚Äôs water. It will probably
            improve it, by removing cow dung and corn fungicide currently used
            on the property.
          </p>
          <p>
            Streams and wetlands: The site contains streams and wetlands. To
            protect them, the solar panels will be placed 100 feet away, as
            required by state law. Forests: Trees capture greenhouse gases, so
            clearing forests to make room for panels is bad for the climate as
            well as the community. Forests cover 45% of the Shepherd‚Äôs Run site.
            According to Hecate, the small number of trees that dot the farm may
            be removed, but none of the forest groves that surround it will be
            cleared. And new trees will be planted around the facility to
            protect views.

            <strong>Do the panels themselves hurt birds? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Solar towers do harm birds, but that‚Äôs a totally different
            technology. Photovoltaic solar panels probably don‚Äôt. Based on
            experiences at a single solar farm in the water-poor Southwest,
            scientists have proposed that water-loving birds may mistake the
            panels for lakes and crash into them. However, this ‚Äúlake effect‚Äù
            hypothesis has not been proven. Anecdotal evidence from solar farms
            in the water-rich Northeast suggests little to no lake effect in the
            region. Though we won‚Äôt know for sure until more studies are done.

            <strong>Will the project help birds?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Shepherd‚Äôs Run will help our avian friends in two ways:
            <ol>
              <li>
                By housing native plants that support birds, and keeping
                predators out, the solar farm will create a sanctuary for them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Two-thirds of American birds are facing extinction from climate
                change. Large solar farms that take a real bite out of the
                problem are essential for protecting them. That‚Äôs why the
                National Audubon Society supports grid-scale solar.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What about the nearby Audubon bird sanctuary?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Solar panels likely don‚Äôt hurt birds, and the native plants around
            the panels will help them. This means Shepherd‚Äôs Run will likely
            support, rather than harm, the neighboring Rheinstrom Hill Audubon
            bird sanctuary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What about endangered species?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Residents have also raised specific concerns aboutthe following
            threatened or endangered birds of prey. Happily, they probably won‚Äôt
            be affected:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bald eagles nest in cliffs and trees near large lakes, and eat
                mostly fish. Fields are of little interest.
              </li>
              <li>
                Peregrine falcons nest on bridges, buildings, and cliffs ‚Äî not
                in fields. They are rarely seen in the Hudson Valley, as there
                are less than 100 pairs left in the state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Northern Harriers nest in prairies - which the corn fields have
                already eliminated and the solar farm will partially restore -
                and in wetlands - which the solar farm will preserve. Moreover,
                they are infrequently seen in Columbia County because they
                usually breed further upstate.

          </p>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, because of nationwide electric codes, large solar

            Copake wants to preserve prime farmland, and has a plan to do just
            that. Although panels will replace the corn and cattle currently on
            the Rasweiler farm for a few decades, Shepherd‚Äôs Run will ultimately
            strengthen Copake‚Äôs farmland.
          </p>
          <p>
            Restored Soil Shepherd‚Äôs Run can make the land more ‚Äúprime.‚Äù
            According to Bill Rasweiler, the farm‚Äôs owner, the soil has been
            depleted by three decades of monocrop corn farming. Letting that
            soil rest, and plating native vegetation, will restore its nutrients
            and micro-organisms. That will improve the soil‚Äôs quality and raise
            the land‚Äôs agricultural value.
          </p>
          <p>
            To preserve farms, you need to support farmers. Legal protection
            against development But it could also promote long-term
            conservation. Hecate is only leasing the land from the farmers.
            There‚Äôs nothing preventing the farmers from returning to agriculture
            once the panels are gone, and the project will support them
            financially until then. But there‚Äôs also nothing preventing them
            from using the land for something else. Shepherd‚Äôs Run could change
            that. As part of the project, the owners could attach a conservation
            easement to the property. This would make it illegal to use the land
            for anything other than farming and clean energy, even if it gets
            sold.

            The reality is that very little rigorous research has been done on
            the impact of solar farms on property values. But here‚Äôs what we do
            know.*
          </p>
          <p>
            The only good academic study out there (Gaur & Lang, 2020), which
            looks at solar farms in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, concludes:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              ‚ÄúResults suggest that houses within one mile depreciate 1.7%
              following construction of a solar array.‚Äù
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            (p. 2) However, those results are for the entire state. The impact
            is different in the countryside:
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              ‚ÄúThese results suggest that the treatment effect in rural areas is
              effectively zero (a statistically insignificant 0.1%), and that
              the negative externalities of solar arrays are only occurring in
              non-rural areas. These findings go against our intuition. One
              possibility is that land is abundant in rural areas, so the
              development of some land into solar does little to impact
              scarcity, whereas in non-rural areas it makes a noticeable
              impact.‚Äù
            </em>
            (p. 17)
          </p>
          <p>
            So in neighboring states, solar projects in rural areas like ours
            have no discernible impact on home values. But let‚Äôs assume the
            ‚Äúworst case‚Äù scenario, and see how it would impact Copake
            homeowners. Notice that Copake Lake, Copake, and Hillsdale are all
            farther than a mile away. Only TK% of homes in Copake (and
            Hillsdale?) are within one mile of Shepherd‚Äôs Run. Under the study‚Äôs
            scenario, those homes would lose around 2% of their value. This
            isn‚Äôt great, of course. Nobody wants their property value to go
            down! But it shouldn‚Äôt jeopardize anyone‚Äôs finances, either. If your
            home is worth $250k, and the property value goes down by 2%, you‚Äôd
            end up with $245k. And that ignores the fact that Columbia County
            property values have exploded by 30% in the past 6 months alone.
            That $250K home is now worth¬†$325K. This probably isn‚Äôt temporary:
            Demand will likely keep growing if so many people continue working
            remotely after the pandemic. *We found only one study by economists
            that actually measured the impact of solar farms on nearby home
            sales using real data on 419,000 home sales, statistical models, and
            quasi-experimental methods ‚Äî the gold standard for estimating the
            causal impact of disamenities on property values. All other studies
            ask property assessors for their subjective opinion, and most are
            funded by the solar industry. One often-cited study from the LBJ
            School of Public Affairs relies on surveys from just 37 assessors.
            This is a tiny sample, and you really want to measure the impact
            using hard data on thousands of home sales, not a couple dozen web
            surveys that ask assessors about their subjective impressions. Even
            then, the conclusion: ‚ÄúThe majority of responses suggested either no
            impact (66 percent of all estimates) on home prices, or a positive
            impact (11 percent of all estimates), as a result of proximity to
            solar installations. However, some respondents did estimate a
            negative impact on home prices associated with solar installations.

            climate change, we need to quickly build a massive amount of solar
            and other renewable energy. To do that, solar energy needs to be
            cheaper than natural gas, the fossil fuel that generates 30% of New
            York‚Äôs electricity. Brownfield development is significantly more
            expensive: Landfills are unstable and full of methane, parking-lot
            pavement must be removed, industrial sites have to be cleaned up.
            This drives up the price and usually makes solar more expensive than
            natural gas, which is a deal-breaker.

            To hook into the grid, solar farms need to connect to a substation.
            Substations are often in towns, so finding one by farmland and with
            interested landowners isn‚Äôt easy.

            Another excellent idea! But if we‚Äôre serious about fighting climate
            change, we have to care about the cost of solar projects. The
            further we place the solar farm from the substation, the more
            transmission line we need to run. This is not only unsightly, it‚Äôs
            surprisingly expensive. Insert stat here****
          </p>
          <p>
            So the project needs to be in Craryville or the numbers just don‚Äôt
            add up, and we get more fossil fuels.

            It can be, up to a point! In fact, in response to community
            concerns, Hecate has already cut the project down twice: from 500
            acres to 360, and from 360 to TK.
          </p>
          <p>
             But it still needs to be hundreds
            of acres, not dozens. We just can‚Äôt solve the climate problem 10
            acres at a time. The problem is too massive, and we‚Äôre out of time.

            The idea that Shepherd‚Äôs Run is ‚Äútoo big‚Äù for Copake is appealing.
            ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre a small town, the solar farms should be small too!‚Äù
          </p>
          <p>
            But consider this: If all the solar farms we have to build in New York
            were the size of Shepherd‚Äôs Run, we‚Äôd need to build hundreds of
            them. In just one or two decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            {/* <GRAPHIC OF HUNDREDS OF DOTS ON THE NYS MAP> */}
            That‚Äôs already a <em>huge</em> undertaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if the farms are all 10 acres, we‚Äôll need thousands. And because of all the regulations solar farms need to satisfy, all projects take years to develop, no matter their size.
          </p>
          <p>
            So Shepherd‚Äôs Run isn‚Äôt actually too big. It‚Äôs just right. At 60MW, it‚Äôs actually one of the smallest grid-scale solar farms being planned in New York state!
          </p>
          <p>
             If you‚Äôre pro-climate, this is what a real climate solution really looks like. We‚Äôre finally doing something about global warming: Serious projects like Shepherd‚Äôs Run are about to be built all over New York state, and not a moment too soon.
