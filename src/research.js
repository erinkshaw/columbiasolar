            🌱 <b>Restored Soil</b> <br/>
            Shepherd’s Run can make the land more “prime.”  
            According to Bill Rasweiler, the biggest landowner supporting the project, 
            the soil has been depleted by three decades of monocrop corn farming.

            That will improve the soil’s quality and raise the land’s agricultural value.

          <p>
            👩‍🌾 <b>A lifeline for farmers</b><br/>
            To preserve farms, you need to suppot farmers. Unfortunately, farms in the Hudson Valley 
            have been declining for decades.
          </p>
          <p><iframe width="600" height="371" seamless frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQxjRhzetR1pTR2vorQx3ifb-lzPX3qbaoITMLVyNQKgmrZEagyJxdYZmfH_0kUHZOP1tPOXUH97YxL/pubchart?oid=1920960119&amp;format=interactive"></iframe></p>
          <p>
            To reverse this trend, farmers need new ways of making money. Solar farms are a great financial 
            lifeline: they provide steady income and improve soil quality, which helps farmers stay in business
            for the long-term.
          </p>
          <p>
            In fact, Copake’s own Agricultural and Farmland Protection plan <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20485435-town-of-copake-agricultural-and-farmland-protection-plan-part-1#document/p29/a2018991">
            explicitly encourages</a> farmers to adopt
            solar in order to preserve farmland.
          </p>
          <p>
            🏡 <b>Preventing real estate development for good</b><br/>
            Shepherd’s Farm could also ensure that the farmland is legally protected for good. 
          </p>
          <p>Hecate is only <a hre="http://www.shepherdsrunsolar.com/local-benefits/">leasing</a> 
             the property from the farmers. They retain ownership of the land, 
            and no permanent structures will be built on the property, so there’s nothing preventing 
            the owners from going back to farming once the panels are gone. 
          </p>
          <p>
            But there’s also nothing preventing them from using the land for <a href="https://beta.documentcloud.org/documents/20508998-town-of-copake-zoning-table-of-land-use-regulations">
            residential and even some commercial development</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shepherd’s Run could change that. As part of the project, the owners could attach a 
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conservation_easement">conservation easement</a> to the property.
            This would make it illegal to use the land for anything other than farming and clean energy, even if it gets sold.

            <strong>Do the panels hurt birds? </strong>
          </p>
          <p>Solar towers do harm birds, but that’s a totally different technology. </p>
          <p>Potovoltaic solar panels probably don’t. Based on experiences at a single 
            solar farm in the water-poor Southwest, scientists proposed that water-loving 
            birds may mistake the panels for lakes and crash into them. </p>
          <p>However, this “lake effect” hypothesis has not been proven. Anecdotal 
            evidence from solar farms in the water-rich Northeast suggests little to
             no lake effect in the region. Though we won’t know for sure until more 
             studies are done.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Will the project help birds?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Shepherd’s Run will help our avian friends in two ways:
            <ol>
              <li>
                By housing native plants that support birds, and keeping
                predators out, the solar farm will create a sanctuary for them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Two-thirds of American birds are facing extinction from climate
                change. Large solar farms that take a real bite out of the
                problem are essential for protecting them. That’s why the
                National Audubon Society supports grid-scale solar.
              </li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What about the nearby Audubon bird sanctuary?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Solar panels likely don’t hurt birds, and the native plants around
            the panels will help them. This means Shepherd’s Run will likely
            support, rather than harm, the neighboring Rheinstrom Hill Audubon
            bird sanctuary.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>What about endangered species?</strong>
          </p>
          <p>
            Residents have also raised specific concerns about the following
            threatened or endangered birds of prey. Happily, they probably won’t
            be affected:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Bald eagles nest in cliffs and trees near large lakes, and eat
                mostly fish. They have been spotted in Copake, but they don’t 
                depend on bodies of water, not fields.
              </li>
              <li>
                Peregrine falcons nest on bridges, buildings, and cliffs — not
                in fields. They are rarely seen in the Hudson Valley, as there
                are less than 100 pairs left in the state.
              </li>
              <li>
                Northern Harriers nest in prairies - which the corn fields have
                already eliminated and the solar farm will partially restore -
                and in wetlands - which the solar farm will preserve. Moreover,
                they are infrequently seen in Columbia County because they
                usually breed further upstate.

            Hecate initially considered allowing foxes, raccoons, and other

            fence.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, to avoid the liability of people running around between the panels, 
            Hecate is required to fully fence in the solar farm. Small animals — 
            as well as deer, bears, and other large animals — will need to go around the fence. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Local animals already have to do this with the Copake Agricultural Center’s 192 
            fenced-in acres in the middle of town, or the 800 fenced-in acres at the Shagbark 
            tree farm. However, the 360-acre project will be split into four separate enclosures,

          The only good academic study (Gaur & Lang, 2020) we could find measures 
          the impact of 204 solar farms in Massachusetts and Rhode Island on 400k home sales.

            Those results are for the <i>entire</i> state, however, both rural and urban areas.

              “These results suggest that the treatment effect in rural areas is
              <b>effectively zero</b> (a statistically insignificant 0.1%), and that
              the negative externalities of solar arrays are only occurring in
              non-rural areas. These findings go against our intuition.” (p. 17)

          <p>
           So at least in Massachusetts and Rhode Island, solar projects in rural areas
            like ours have <b>no discernible impact</b> on home values. 
          </p>
          <p><b>Worst case scenario</b></p>
          <p>But let’s assume a worst case scenario and see what happens. 
            Homes within a mile of Shepherd’s Run - more likely, the few dozen homes 
            that view the solar farm or are right next to it - could lose up to 
           2% of their value.
           </p>
           <p>
             This isn’t ideal. Understandably, nobody wants their property value to go down.
           </p>
           <p>
             But thankfully, it shouldn’t jeopardize anyone’s finances either. 
             If your home is worth $250k, and the property value goes down by 2%, 
             it would still be worth $245k.

              Moreover, this 2% drop is tiny compared to the 30% jump in home values we’ve seen in Columbia County 
              since the start of the pandemic (Feb 2020-Feb 2021).

              So that $250K home is now probably worth $325K. And it'll probably keep appreciating: 
              interest in our area will continue to grow if many people keep working remotely after the pandemic.

              * We found only one study by economists that actually measured the impact of solar farms
               on nearby home sales. The study used real data on 419,000 home sales, and used statistical
                models to compare the prices of homes near solar farms with those of similar homes elsewhere. 
                This is the gold standard for quantifying the effect of disamenities on property values.
            </i></p>
            <p><i>
              All other studies ask a handful of property assessors for their opinion, and most are funded 
              by the solar industry. One often-cited study from the LBJ School of Public Affairs relies on 
              surveys from just 37 assessors. This is a tiny sample. And you want to answer this question by
              analyzing hard data on thousands of home sales, not by asking a couple dozen assessors for 
              their subjective opinion.
            </i></p> 
            <p><i>
              Despite those flaws, the study concludes: “Results from our survey of
              home assessors show that the majority of respondents believe that proximity to a solar installation
              either had no impact or positive impact on home values (p. 23)

            Solar panels very rarely start fires. We know this because, even though the US

            only 120 of Germany’s 2 million solar installations stared a fire. In Japan, 
            only 127 of 2.4 million did. That’s only .006% of all solar systems.

            Moreover, Hecate is required to pay special district property taxes to the 
            Fire Department. So the fire department will actually get a significant funding 
            boost in exchange for a minuscule increase in fire risk.

            In New York State, if you want to build a solar farm less than 25MW, 
            the town alone can approve or deny the project. If it’s greater than 25MW, 
            however, a state siting board - made up of 5 state appointees and 2 
            local ones - must approve it. 
          </p>
          <p>
            Shepherd’s Run is 60MW, so Hecate has no option but to go through the 
            State-level article 10 siting process (or the new 94C process).
            They can negotiate with the Town of Copake, but ultimately the 
            siting board still has to approve.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the board approves the project - which requires complying with 
            extensive environmental and economic regulations - then Hecate is 
            legally authorized to build.
          </p>
          <p>
            At that point, Shepherd’s Run is legal even though it doesn’t comply
             with local zoning rules, because state law can supersede local law in
              New York when it comes to solar farm siting.

          We need to build around 360 square miles of solar in the next 15 to 20 years to reach 100% clean energy in New York State, according to solar power expert Dr. Richard Perez of SUNY Albany.

            This is a great idea, but there’s a catch. If we want to beat
            climate change, we need to quickly build a massive amount of solar
            and other renewable energy. To do that, solar energy needs to be
            cheaper than natural gas, the fossil fuel that generates 30% of New
            York’s electricity. Brownfield development is significantly more
            expensive: Landfills are unstable and full of methane, parking-lot
            pavement must be removed, industrial sites have to be cleaned up.
            This drives up the price and usually makes solar more expensive than
            natural gas, which is a deal-breaker.

            Another excellent idea! But if we’re serious about fighting climate
            change, we have to care about the cost of solar projects. The
            further we place the solar farm from the substation, the more
            transmission line we need to run. This is not only unsightly, it’s
            surprisingly expensive. Insert stat here****

            So the project needs to be in Craryville or the numbers just don’t

            It can be, up to a point! In fact, in response to community
            concerns, Hecate has already cut the project down twice: from 500
            acres to 360, and from 360 to TK.
          </p>
          <p>
             But it still needs to be hundreds
            of acres, not dozens. We just can’t solve the climate problem 10
            acres at a time. The problem is too massive, and we’re out of time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea that Shepherd’s Run is “too big” for Copake is appealing.
            “We’re a small town, the solar farms should be small too!”
          </p>
          <p>
            But consider this: If all the solar farms we have to build in New York
            were the size of Shepherd’s Run, we’d need to build hundreds of
            them. In just one or two decades.
          </p>
          <p>
            {/* <GRAPHIC OF HUNDREDS OF DOTS ON THE NYS MAP> */}
            That’s already a <em>huge</em> undertaking.
          </p>
          <p>
            But if the farms are all 10 acres, we’ll need thousands. And because of all the regulations solar farms need to satisfy, all projects take years to develop, no matter their size.
          </p>
          <p>
            So Shepherd’s Run isn’t actually too big. It’s just right. At 60MW, it’s actually one of the smallest grid-scale solar farms being planned in New York state!
          </p>
          <p>
             If you’re pro-climate, this is what a real climate solution really looks like. We’re finally doing something about global warming: Serious projects like Shepherd’s Run are about to be built all over New York state, and not a moment too soon.
