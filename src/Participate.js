        <p>
          Opponents to Shepherd's Run have been very visible in our community,
          but supporters have not. We need to turn that around.

          project.

        <p>
          Yard signs are critical for spreading awareness about why Shepherd's
          Run represents real climate action, and how it can help Copake reduce
          taxes, slash electricity bills, and restore farmland.
