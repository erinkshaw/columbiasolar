          <b>A note on project impacts</b>: to comply with New York state regulations, 
          Hecate is studying how the solar farm will affect local agriculture, birds, 
          water quality, property values, and dozens of other topics. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The studies are ongoing, and expected to be published this summer. 
          Weâ€™ll know a lot more about the projectâ€™s impact then, and this page 
          will be updated accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          Until then, this page is based on academic studies, evidence from other solar 
          projects, and local knowledge about the community.
