          *A note on project impacts: to comply with New York state regulations,
          Hecate is studying how the solar farm will affect local agriculture,
          birds, water quality, property values, and dozens of other topics.
        </p>
        <p>
          The studies are happening now, and are expected to be published by the
          summer. Weâ€™ll know a lot more about the projectâ€™s impact then, and this
          page will be updated accordingly.
        </p>
        <p>
          For now, the arguments we make below about how Shepherdâ€™s Runs will
          affect Copake are based on evidence from other solar projects, academic
          studies, and local knowledge about the proposed project area.
