        <p>Nope, weâ€™re not an Astroturf group set up by Hecate Energy.</p>
        <p>
          Weâ€™re your neighbors. We feel that a lot of outdated and false
          information about Shepherdâ€™s Run has been circulating in the
          community. We want to make sure the project happens, and we want to
          make sure it benefits our town as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our country has spent the past 30 years dragging its feet on climate
          change. Weâ€™ve run out of time and need massive, realistic action now.
        </p>
        <p>
          Itâ€™s not somebody elseâ€™s problem. Itâ€™s going to take all of us. So
          letâ€™s lead the charge.
