        We are committed to challenging disinformation about climate change.

      <p>
        Disinformation, the deliberate spreading of false information - in other
        words, flat out lying - has become a fact of life when it comes to the
        climate catastrophe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where is the disinformation coming from? Ask yourself: Who has the most
        to gain? Clearly not climate scientists. The fossil fuel industry is the
        responsible party, or rather the irresponsible party.
      </p>
      <p>
        Powered by disinformation purveyed by the fossil fuel industry and its
        surrogates, organized resistance to solar and wind farms has become a
        national issue.
