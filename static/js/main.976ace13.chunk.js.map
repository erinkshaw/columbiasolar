Just a few years ago, this agriculture-based community organization was about to close its doors. Most of the community is no longer rooted in agriculture, but the community rallied to preserve this part of our history. The Copake Grange has emerged as a changed and thriving organization responding to the wider needs of a more diverse community. I believe most of us view this as positive change.  But what should we do with change that we do not choose and may not want — specifically the proposed Shepherd's Run solar project?\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen my wife and I first started coming to Copake, we would drive on Route 7 to get to Route 23 on the way to Hudson. I remember cruising down that road on hot summer days, cornfields flanking us, that red barn on the right, and straight ahead of us a majestic oak tree. For a couple of years, that tree encapsulated rural beauty for me. There was something perfect about it. But then it lost a limb, and another, and then another — and a few years ago, what remained was cut down. No more oak tree. That pastoral marker was gone, and I mourned it.  \n</p>\n<p>\nBut I had to make my peace with change. For that tree, change carried itself out over a span of 20 years. Sometimes, if you're lucky, that's the way change works, titrating itself into your life so that its pain and disruption are easier to take. And sometimes change just falls on top of you.\n</p>\n<p>\nThat is probably the way it will be with Shepherd's Run. And we are all anticipating it. After the solar company gets the go-ahead, the project will go up in the space of a year. The whole valley alongside Route 7 will be solar panels. There will be trees and shrubs to try to hide them, but, let's face it, the area will look different.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the houses bordering the area, the sense of place will change. Homeowners originally bought this land across the road from cornfields. Now it'll be black shiny things. But I feel for future generations too. Putting solar panels and/or windmills on farmland (as opposed to other ways that farmland is being developed) just could be what best preserves this as farmland for our children and grandchildren, as we develop better ways to power the world.\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen I look at the devastation from floods and fires in the American West, and I see Antarctica calving ice floes that are about twice the size of New York City, I can't help but believe we can do better. We are losing more species than at any time since the dinosaurs' unfortunate meteor encounter.  \n</p>\n<p>\nI grew up believing we had to work to take care of the earth. When I was growing up in the '60s, we would recycle newspapers and cans and bottles. It was just something we were taught had to be done. That was more than 50 years ago. \n</p>\n<p>\nWe knew then. This isn't news. And it's not sudden. We've had plenty of opportunity to do something. While there have been a growing movement and growing awareness of our imminent decline, we haven't really been able to step up to the plate. Sure, we could blame it on a relentless disinformation campaign by the fossil-fuel industry and its stakeholders, but, really, it's us. This is hard, and we don't want to make the sacrifices necessary to save the planet. \n</p>\n<p>\nDoing the right thing is frequently a challenge. \n</p>\n<p>\nTo reach carbon neutrality in New York state by 2050, we will need to have solar panels on all parking lots, industrial buildings, every other house — and solar farms of 60 megawatts or larger around every electrical substation in the state. Even if we don't like particular aspects of what a solar company may be planning for a site near a substation, we need to go with it — because it means something is being built that will help stave off climate disaster. And we don't have a better idea on deck.\n</p>\n<p>\nOur community is quite well off compared to many other rural areas. Other towns have opted to host industrial-size solar farms because they don't have the tax base to turn down the revenue these projects can bring in. So many of us are transplanted or retired New Yorkers who are not struggling. If we host this solar farm, it's not because we have to but because we want to. It's an opportunity for us to \"think globally and act locally.\"\n</p>\n<p>\nIs this farm going to save the world? Of course not. It's essentially a drop in the bucket. But it's like a vote: It won't make a difference all by itself, but combined with many others, it will get someone elected.\n</p>\n`;\n\nconst DAN = `\n<p>\nDan Haas\n</p>\n<p>\nThirty five years in Copake have given me a lot of reasons to love the town.  There’s the beauty of the Taconic mountains, visible from my front porch.  There’s the quiet pleasure of walking from my house into “town” to buy groceries, get my hair cut, get lunch, go to the bank, maybe just walk quiet streets, and count on the likelihood of chatting with someone I know.  Maybe most important is the fact that my kids lived happy childhoods here, exploring on their bikes, fishing in the pond behind the bank, smacking baseballs into the graveyard next door.\nSo I’ve tried to give back, by coaching Little League, helping write a Comprehensive Plan, serving on the Board of the Harlem Valley Rail Trail Association for more years than I like to admit, stepping up to coordinate the town’s Climate Smart Task Force, and, for the last couple of years, co-chairing Friends of Columbia Solar and advocating for the building of Shepherd’s Run solar farm.\n</p>\n<p>\nI’m well aware that many in town wouldn’t count this last involvement as “giving back.”  Town meetings, letters to editors, editorials, websites, social media, and mostly, conversations have outlined the understandable objections to the project.  \n</p>\n<p>\nLike opponents, I cherish the beauty of Copake. That’s why I’ve worked hard to support a 220 acre, 60 megawatt project.  Given the urgency of the threat of climate change, we must choose whether to take concrete action now, or risk serious, maybe disastrous consequences in the not so distant future.  \n</p>\n<p>\nWith all my heart, I wish it was crazy to state that climate change may be “the gravest threat humanity has ever faced.”  It’s not crazy.  Copake, so far, has escaped the worst effects, but coming decades may bring damaged agriculture, die-off of key tree species, droughts and floods.  If millions are displaced by lethal heat, how could that not effect Copake?  If animal species go extinct at a rate not seen since the Permian, how could that not effect Copake?\n</p>\n<p>\nAlmost without exception, people I’ve spoken to agree that climate change is a serious issue — but Shepherd’s Run is the wrong solution.  When asked for a better one, nothing is offered beyond “statewide planning” or perhaps a vague hope for hydrogen cells or nuclear power.  \n</p>\n<p>\nBut the choices we face are not as stark as they appear at first glance.  Rather than condemn the project because it displaces agriculture, why not figure out how to combine solar panels and farming?   Rather than fret that the visual character of the area will be lost, why not push the developer to do a better job of screening?  In general, why not work to make this a better project?  That’s been the approach of Friends of Columbia Solar, as well as the organizations that formed the Working Group.  Town meetings, publicity, lobbying by the Working Group have resulted in concessions from Hecate, documented in their latest application.  Building this solar project doesn’t have to result in a dire threat to the town’s future. Inaction? That might.\n</p>\n`;\n\nconst ELAYNE = `\n<p>\nElayne Dix\n</p>\n<p>\nWhen my husband and I found our property, we felt like we were in heaven. The quiet, the smells (especially early morning), the birds! There was a pond nearby where a bullfrog ruled at dusk. Amazement at all the creatures sharing the land.\n</p>\n<p>\nCraryville was quieter 40-plus years ago. We lived on a road where there was hardly any traffic. I walked over Birch Hill Road to shop on Route 23. That would take half a day, because there was a group of birches swaying, the mooing cows, and, at the top of that road, a glimpse of the pond that could only be seen with imagination, since there was no clearing. It was thrilling to come upon the big old oak nodding over the stream and the bumpy, tremulous little wooden bridge.\n</p>\n<p>\nWe came here for these gifts. Our neighborhoods in the city had undergone changes, and we were busy within that noisy bubble with jobs and family responsibilities.\n</p>\n<p>\nLooking back over my considerable decades, I realize the city was always changing. And often fast. Sometimes, overnight, a favorite building or business is gone.\n</p>\n<p>\nBut country areas change more slowly. The seasons are the obvious markers. But in reality, farms go out of business and multifamily homes are built. A stream dries up, vegetation and animal life change, so a road is added.\n</p>\n<p>\nZoning accommodates a new business. A new school campus goes up, thankfully providing education, sports, a library for current and future generations. But a lovely field is taken. Where are those deer we watched at sunset? That bullfrog?\n</p>\n<p>\nThe hills and woods in Craryville will change. The urgent new story is climate crisis — and our responsibility to act in the best interests of our grandchildren. There will be beauty and life left in the fields. It will be shared with the structures we know will produce cleaner power.\n</p>\n<p>\nI understand the feelings of loss. To some degree, with that feeling, we have all experienced changes. There will be noise, dust, interference. For some, it'll be far worse than for others. Then it will be over. And the green will fill in. \n</p>\n`;\n\nconst GARY = `\n<p>\nGary Lewis\n</p>\n<p>\nLike many people, my wife, Peggy, and I moved to this area to escape development sprawl (in our case it was Poughkeepsie, just one county to the south). We were in awe of this region’s rural beauty. \n</p>\n<p>\nTwo hundred and twenty acres of solar panels on agricultural land will certainly change the landscape. We don’t believe, however, that the Shepherd's Run solar project will ruin the community, a fear expressed by many of our neighbors. What truly makes a community a great place to live is not its landscape, but its people. We have confidence in the people we have met over our ten years in the area — and that whatever the outcome of the proposed development, our community will remain strong by continuing to work together to create a better place to live, work, and play.\n</p>\n<p> \nAfter we had several close calls with cars while road-biking near Poughkeepsie, safer, less-traveled roads were another reason for our move. Soon after moving, we were invited to join a Town of Copake–sponsored committee to promote the town as a road-biking destination. It was on this committee that I first got to know and appreciate the people of this area as much as its natural beauty. The committee included members of both major political parties, ages ranging from young twenties to retired, and locals, long-term transplants, and newcomers like us. \n</p>\n<p>\nI was impressed by how smoothly we all worked together keeping our focus on creating an event that everyone in the community could participate in and benefit from. The committee sponsored the first Roe Jan Ramble — accepting my suggestion for one of my favorite local rides — and I became the “route master” for every subsequent Roe Jan Ramble. The Roe Jan Ramble has become a fantastic community celebration of our astounding rural landscape. The ride continues to grow and to introduce more and more people to this beautiful place we are fortunate to call home.\n</p>\n<p>\nI have seen the same diversity, spirit, and enthusiasm from the community members who have organized in opposition to the Shepherd’s Run project. Even though I support the project, I am happy that there are so many passionate people willing to work so hard on behalf of their community.  Although I have a different perspective on the project, I believe I share with the opponents the same good intention to do what is best for our community.\n</p>\n<p>\nNo community, including ours, will go unscathed unless we act swiftly and decisively to mitigate climate disruption caused by global warming. Although not perfect, the New York State Climate Act is precisely the kind of action we should all support and work through the legislative process. To meet its objectives, we need large solar projects, and they need to be efficient in order to be economically feasible. So, from my perspective, Shepherd’s Run is appropriately sized to the needs, and logically sited to be an efficient development project.\n</p>\n<p>\nI agree, as a general matter, that any development this large is not in keeping with the character of the community as expressed in the thoughtful town plan. In this case, however, it is my opinion that the greater good of the community, from local to global, outweighs the potential harms, most of which can be mitigated.\n</p>\n<p>\nFor the last three years, the Roe Jan Ramble included six routes consisting of 10, 18, 25, 35, 50, and 62 miles, which wind through the towns of Copake, Hillsdale, and Ancram. There is not a single stretch of any route that passes the proposed site. In 10 years of the rides, only once did a route traverse Birch Hill Road to Route 23 to Hillsdale. We discontinued this ride because no one likes biking on Route 23, but if the solar project is built, featuring landscaping for screening and help from developer Hecate in extending the rail trail, even more beautiful biking will open in this area.\n</p>\n<p>\nI do genuinely feel for those in proximity to the proposed site who will be most disrupted if the project is approved. Unfortunately, everyone is being impacted by climate change, and almost any large infrastructure project is going to negatively affect someone. In the history of our country, the brunt of those effects has been borne by disadvantaged communities. I do not think we can fairly avoid our responsibility to be part of the climate-mitigation solution, but I am willing to stand by my neighbors in their reasonable requests for mitigation.\n</p>\n<p>\nThis is why I fully support the ad hoc Working Group, whose set of recommendations addresses this need but does not include either a reduction in project size or relocation of the site. I do not believe these demands can or should be unilaterally levied upon Hecate, but they do serve as a solid basis for good-faith negotiations, or for consideration by ORES as permit conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\nI don't claim to know what is best for this community, and I try to remain open to other perspectives and the possibility that I may be wrong. If the project is approved, I am prepared to work side by side with my neighbors to make it the best possible project it can be for this community. If it isn't approved, I hope its opponents will join with me to work just as hard to find other ways for our community to help mitigate climate disruption and to continue their efforts regarding issues they have raised, from protecting the Taghkanic watershed to becoming allies with the indigenous peoples who have been displaced from this land.\n</p>\n<p>\nIf the community continues to work together toward goals like these, we will all be winners.\n</p>\n`;\n\nconst Essays = ({ author }) => {\n  const essays = {\n    dan: DAN,\n    harry: HARRY,\n    elayne: ELAYNE,\n    gary: GARY,\n
